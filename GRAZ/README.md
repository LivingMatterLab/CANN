# Input: brain data, same as in \BRAIN
Uniaxial tension/compression and simple shear data

# Instructions
1. Download `input` folder and `BrainCANN.ipynb` and upload them to your Google Drive account
2. Change `path` to direct to where you put these files
3. Run the code blocks sequentially

# Debugging Common Issues
1. Make sure you are using the correct matplotlib and tensorflow versions by running the second code block where you can check the versions.
2. Make sure all the code blocks have been checked; missing one would prevent the code from running.
